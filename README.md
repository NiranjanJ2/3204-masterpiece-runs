# 3204-masterpiece-runs
These are the FLL runs for 3204 so that anyone can code them.
How this will work is that when you code a run, instead of just saving it to your computer, you would copy past the code onto here so it is available for the entire team and  easily editable by anyone if there is something wrong. 
This resolves the problem of only being able to code on Millan's computer and backs up the code in case the file corrupts like it did last year.
When you are done coding a run or are taking a break, just put the code here
Before the competition, we can just take the code from here and put it on the hub.
This also helps in the case of the UI, where we have to import files.
